Choices and assumptions:
- I made pages for must haves (List of bottles, Detail view, Possibility of adding) and a nice to have component (Search function). 
- I chose a dark brown theme which matches a dark beer. I chose a dark color to show a bit of class. 
- I added a border to the beers so it was easier to seperate them visually.
- I only chose to add the image and the name of the beer for minimal information on the front page, but adding more information on the detailed view page.
- I added a light yellow background so the page wouldn't look bland.

Improvements
- Add external API. Show list of all beers when adding a new beer for easier add.
- Make detailed view page more specific, by taking the ID of the clicked container and matching with the ID from the Json/API and adding other data.
- Make img in Adding page upload img instead of img url. 
- Add sort by name/brewery/type of beer for more filtering options other than searching.
- Using firebase instead of json for dynamic changing of database.
- Make website responsive.
